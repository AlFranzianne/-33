    <h2>For My Baby ❤️</h2>
    <p>
      My love,
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Valentine's Day! I can’t even begin to put into words how much you mean to me. From the moment we met, you’ve been the best part of my life—my happiness, my comfort, my home. Every second with you is a gift, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      You make my world brighter with your smile, your laugh, and all the little things you do. You make love feel easy, warm, and safe, and I’m so lucky to have you by my side. Whether we’re sharing deep conversations or just enjoying the quiet moments, every moment with you is my favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promise to always cherish you, to always be there for you, and to love you with everything I have. Today and always, you are my heart, my happiness, and my greatest love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Valentine’s Day, my baby. I love you more than words can say.
    </p>
    <p class="signature">— Yours Truly, Al :33</p>
